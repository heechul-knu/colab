# Term Project for Final Exam
- Goal: Achieve the best performance on CIFAR-10 dataset in this class.
- Submit a report that describes your method and the results. (~11:59pm, 8th Dec. 2021)
- I am going to share your report with other students.
- (Recommendation!) Share your source code using Github with other students.
- Workshop? Presentation? (Not decided yet.)
<br>

- Evalueation metric: classification rate (%)
- Train data: 50000
- Test data: 10000
- Deep learning framework: Any framework (PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras ...)
- Deep learning architecture: Any architecture
- You can use ImageNet pre-trained model.
<br>

- You can check the state-of-the-art approaches.

- Model constraints!
Some students have some concerns the CIFAR-10 accuracies were saturated as 99.5 when the ViT model was used.
Consequently, I decided to limit the architectures as follows:

AlexNet
VGG
ResNet
SqueezeNet
DenseNet
Inception v3
GoogLeNet
ShuffleNet v2
MobileNetV2
MobileNetV3
ResNeXt
Wide ResNet
MNASNet
EfficientNet
RegNet

You can only use the architectures as a baseline for term project, and you can modify it while maintaining the basic form of the architectures.
